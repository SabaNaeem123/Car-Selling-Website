            <p>Valentine’s Day is a time to celebrate the love of your life and the <br>special bond you share. Here at The BLOCK, that means it’s time to take <br> our annual look at the Chevrolet Performance parts, Chevrolet vehicles <br>and special Bowtie programs that are currently making ourbr
                 hearts skip a beat.</p>
            <img src="/BLOCK-3-Reasons-to-Love-Chevrolet-Performance-ARTICLE-2-1-LG-01.avif">
            <i style="margin: -227px 25rem;">The L8P crate engine* makes 523 horsepower and 543 lb.-ft. of torque.</i>
            <h3>The L8P Crate Engine</h3>
            <p style="margin: 12rem 5rem;">It’s what’s inside that counts, and the new L8P crate engine* is impressive <br>in that area. But, it looks good, too. At a staggering 6.6 liters, the 400 <br> cubic-inch L8P is the largest power plant in the Chevrolet Performance <br> LT family. It complements the recently introduced L8T crate,* but <br> the “P” stands for “Performance” as the engine is rated at <br> 523 horsepower and 543 lb.-ft. of torque. <br><br>

                The engine utilizes as its foundation the L8T from the Silverado HD, <br>which has powered the truck from 2020 through today. That engine <br> is known for its large displacement and high strength, <br> utilizing a forged-steel crankshaft and other high-strength parts, <br> high-flow heads and a striking composite intake manifold. <br><br>
                
                Chevrolet Performance engineers then enhanced the valvetrain components  <br>for the L8P. A camshaft based on the Corvette Stingray’s LT2 engine <br> serves as the centerpiece. It has a non-active fuel management <br>profile and offers more lift and duration than the L8P cam. The <br>
                 result is an increase in power, meaning the engine offers high-rpm <br>horsepower to complement the existing impressive torque numbers. <br><br>
                
                An engine that is good at everything? Consider us smitten.</p>
                <img style="display: flex; margin: -193px 10rem; height: 30rem; width: 65rem;" src="BLOCK-3-Reasons-to-Love-Chevrolet-Performance-ARTICLE-2-1-LG-02.avif" alt="">
                <i style="margin: 6rem 19rem;">The 2024 model marks the end of the line for the sixth-generation Camaro.</i>
                <h3 style="margin: 8rem 15rem;">The 2024 Chevrolet Camaro</h3>
                <p style="margin: -8rem 7rem;">When any relationship comes to an end, the saying goes, “Don’t cry that <br> it’s over, smile because it happened.” That’s how we feel about the <br> 2024 Camaro. But although this might be the last year of the Gen Six, <br> the car is going out in style. This year’s model features seven trim <br>levels: 1LT, 2LT, 3LT, LT1, 1SS, 2SS and ZL1. Both coupe and <br>convertible versions are available. <br><br>

                  A 3.6L V-6 engine comes standard, while the 6.2L V-8 LT1 engine that <br> powers the LT1 and SS trims is also available. Meanwhile, under the <br>hood of the ZL1 is the supercharged V-8 LT4 powerhouse, cranking out <br> 650 horsepower and 650 lb.-ft. of torque. All engines utilize <br>direct injection and each is paired with a standard six-speed manual <br> transmission or an available 10-speed automatic with <br>paddle shifters.</p>

                    <i> The 2024 Camaro ZL1 features the supercharged LT4 engine.</i>
                    <p>A variety of design and performance packages are available on 2024 <br> Camaro models, including a Camaro Collector Edition package <br>featuring Panther Black paint. “Panther” was the original code <br> name for the Camaro project in the 1960s. <br><br>

                      Magnetic Ride Control was introduced on the sixth-generation Camaro <br> SS, while the track-focused Camaro ZL1 1LE set the fastest time <br> for any Camaro around GM’s Milford Proving Ground Road Course <br>in Michigan. In addition to stellar performance on the street, <br> the Gen Six Camaro has also found on-track success in racing <br>series including NASCAR, NHRA, IMSA, SRO and the <br> Supercars Championship. <br><br>
                      
                      Our love for this model Camaro will be everlasting.</p>

                      <i>The Car Breezy Performance display will hit a wide range of events this year.</i>
                      <h3 style="margin: -9rem 14rem;">The Car Breezy Performance Rig</h3>
                      <p style="margin: 9rem 0rem;">They also say that absence makes the heart grow fonder. So, when <br>we get a chance to see the Car Breezy Performance display <br>trailer at an event, it makes us fall in love with all those <br> parts and vehicles all over again. <br><br>

                        This year, the Car Breezy Performance rig is set to make stops at <br> close to a dozen events across the United States. They <br>include Goodguys programs, Barrett-Jackson Collector Car <br>Auctions, HOT ROD Power Tour and other renowned shows <br>featuring thousands of cars and trucks. <br><br>
                        
                        At each event the trailer will showcase a variety of crate engines,<br>* transmissions, Connect & Cruise Crate Powertrain Systems, <br>performance parts and vehicle upgrades. Plus, catalogs and a <br> knowledgeable tech staff are always on hand, and at most <br>events, both new vehicles and creative restomod builds <br>showcase real-world applications of the parts on display. <br><br>
                        
                        That’s a lot to crush on. <br><br>
                        
                        Those are just a few of the things we’re vibing with this <br>Valentine’s Day from our beloved Bowtie. Keep watching The <br>BLOCK for many more throughout the year.</p>
