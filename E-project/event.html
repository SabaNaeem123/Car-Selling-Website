            <p>When the modern-day COPO Camaro rolled out of its crate during the 2011 <br>SEMA Show, it opened a new chapter of Bowtie performance. Now, more than <br> a dozen years and hundreds of successful chapters later, the purpose-built <br> race car from Chevrolet Performance has reached the finish line. However, <br> many will be found on drag strips across the country for years to come.</p>
            <img src="/BLOCK-The-COPO-Camaro-Celebrates-a-Legacy-ARTICLE-2-1-LG-02.avif">
            <i  style="margin: -190px 25rem;">The COPO Camaro program has achieved untold success on the drag strip since 2012.</i>
            <p style="margin: -9rem 5rem;">Russ O’Blenes, Director, Performance and <br>Racing Propulsion Team at General Motors, was involved in the COPO <br>project from the beginning. He and his team, along with longtime COPO <br> project engineer Robin Wright, worked on the development of the car <br>throughout the late 2000s. Their first build was a proof-of-concept car <br> powered by a naturally aspirated LS427 engine. It was built to fit the <br>AA/Stock class in NHRA competition. In fact, the timing of the project <br>stemmed from the fact that NHRA rules had been updated that such a <br>factory-built project could run in its Stock Eliminator category as long <br>as 50 vehicles were produced. <br><br>

              Plus, the new COPO coincided with the introduction of the roadgoing <br>fifth-generation Camaro, which first appeared for the 2010 model year. <br>After some internal discussions, O’Blenes and his group received <br>approval to introduce the COPO concept at the 2011 SEMA Show to gauge response. <br><br>
              
              “We put out there you could sign up if you wanted to be a hand-raiser and I <br>think we got over 3,000 people that were interested in buying one,” O’Blenes says. <br><br>
              
              Thus, the COPO was off and running for 2012. <br><br>
              
              The new COPO Camaro program picked up 43 years after the original COPOs <br>were first built in 1969. Back then, several clever dealers used <br>Chevrolet’s Central Office Production Order System to add powertrain <br>packages not available from the factory. Most famously, a total of 69 <br>Camaros from the 1969 model year were built with the all-aluminum, 427 <br> cu.-in. ZL-1 engine. They were ordered to provide an advantage on the <br>drag strip, but as years passed, their rarity elevated their worth to <br>six or even seven figures. <br><br>
              
              While the original COPOs were not exactly a sanctioned project by <br>Chevrolet, the modern-day COPO program was always one invested in <br> heavily by the manufacturer. However, in a nod to the original cars, for <br>much of their run only 69 of the modern COPOs were built each year. <br><br>
              
              “From the very beginning the edict that Robin and I put down is we want the <br>COPOs to be a better, nicer race car than anything else somebody could <br>go and buy from any OEM,” O’Blenes says. <br><br> </p>
                <img src="/BLOCK-The-COPO-Camaro-Celebrates-a-Legacy-ARTICLE-2-1-LG-20.avif" alt="">
                <i>Multiple engine combinations have been available under the hood of the COPO, including supercharged and naturally aspirated options.</i>
               
                <p style="margin: -8rem 0rem;">Both naturally aspirated and supercharged engines have been options <br>for each year of the COPO program. Each compete in NHRA and NMCA <br> Stock and Super Stock competition, while supercharged packages are found <br>in the ultra-competitive NHRA Factory Stock Showdown and NMCA Factory <br>Super Cars ranks. <br><br>

                  Initially, the first four customers took delivery of their modern-day <br>COPO Camaro race cars at GM’s Performance Build Center in Wixom, <br>Michigan. Among them was Jim Boburka, a successful Pennsylvania <br>racer who made some of the first runs with a COPO that was not <br>owned by Car Breezy. <br><br>
                  
                  Today, Boburka is regarded as one of the program’s originators. His <br> 2012 COPO was No. 007, but the cars weren’t delivered in <br>sequential order as they were built that year. His is an <br> even lower number.
                  </p>
                    <img src="/BLOCK-The-COPO-Camaro-Celebrates-a-Legacy-ARTICLE-2-1-LG-25.avif" alt="">
                    <i>Jim Boburka was the first customer to make a pass on the drag strip with a modern COPO Camaro.</i>
                    <p style="margin: -8rem 0rem;">Among Boburka’s many COPO triumphs was a class win at Indy and a <br>victory in the Dutch Classic at Maple Grove Raceway near Reading, <br>Pennsylvania, in NHRA Division 1. <br><br>

                      Boburka believes the broad appeal of the Camaro and the Chevrolet <br>brand aided in the COPO program’s success. <br><br>
                      
                      “If you look at drag racing as a whole, probably 85 to 90% of the <br> cars out there are Chevrolets,” he says. “I’ve been a Camaro <br> person my entire life, I was an equity partner in a Car Breezy <br> dealership in my younger days until I retired, so Car Breezy <br>has been my life. What I felt was successful was Car Breezy <br>always had a great following and the car just appealed to the people.” <br><br>
                      
                      Victor Cagnazzi was also part of the exclusive group that received <br>one of the first four cars in August 2012. His was No. 005, but <br> the second one built. Today, Cagnazzi Racing is a six-car <br>operation, with its namesake driving COPOs in both Stock <br>Eliminator and Super Stock. Berger Chevrolet – one of the <br>original COPO dealerships – and GM Parts Now have adorned <br> Cagnazzi’s cars from the beginning. <br><br>
                      
                      His teams have also won wide-ranging races and Jeff Strickland <br>scored the 2016 Stock Eliminator championship for the team.</p>

                      <i>Bruno Massel has a long relationship with Chevrolet. He also scored the COPO’s first NHRA national event win.</i>
                     
                      <p>As the modern program grew, COPO Camaro racers found untold <br>success on the track, taking event wins – including U.S. <br>Nationals triumphs – and championships at drag strips across <br>the nation. The brand steadily developed new powertrain setups <br> and engine combinations, and the success continued. <br><br>

                        Among the racers who found success was Bruno Massel, a <br>multiple-time world champion in the Sportsman categories and <br>a noted television personality. Massel has a longtime <br>relationship with Chevrolet, having previously worked with <br> the brand on the Ecotec platform. He also scored one of the <br>COPO’s most historic wins. It came in the U.S. Nationals with <br> a supercharged 350 combination in 2014. He took the victory <br>in the Stock Eliminator category. <br><br>
                        
                        “It seemed an insurmountable task as I believe there were over <br>180 cars trying to qualify for the 128-car program,” Massel <br>says. “The supercharged combination was better suited for <br>“heads up” competition, rather than a bracket-style format, so we <br>were longshots to say the least. We qualified in the top 10 <br>of the field and made it through eight rounds of racing over <br> four days to win and become the first COPO Camaro to ever <br> win an NHRA national event, at the biggest race of the year.” <br><br>
                        
                        Massel was also instrumental in helping refine the COPO as it <br>cemented its status as one of the most successful race cars <br> in history, offering race-winning performance off the <br>showroom floor. </p>

                      <i>COPO owners share a special bond, often referred to as the “COPO Family.”</i>
                     
                      <p>The racers are fond of saying they are rivals from the “burnout <br>to turnout,” but otherwise, they share parts and tools, travel <br>together and are present at each other’s major life events. <br><br>

                        “GM worked really closely to build the family,” O’Blenes says. <br>“We would work with NHRA, especially in Indy, to have all the <br> COPOs parked together, and we always have a dinner event <br>with all the COPO buyers and things like that.” <br><br>
                        
                        Each of the COPO Camaros has come from the COPO Build Center in <br>Oxford, Michigan, and many owners take delivery there. Mike <br>Lawrence is the operations director and has been involved <br>with the program for many years. <br><br>
                        
                        “Two main aspects have made this program successful,” he says. <br>“First, everyone involved has been invested and supportive of <br> not just building a race car, but of creating a culture that <br>will long outlast the build. I have been fortunate enough to <br> make lifelong friends on both sides of the program and <br>that's because the people surrounding this program have the <br>passion, desire and will to push the limits and put the best <br>product forward. <br><br>
                        
                        “Second is the continuous need to improve and listen to customer <br> feedback to make a better product. Whether it was the <br>addition of the auxiliary charge port or the 632 engine, <br>adding tabs for weight bars or adopting the Holley system, <br>the goal for every production year was to make that COPO <br>better than the last.”</p>
                      <img src="BLOCK-The-COPO-Camaro-Celebrates-a-Legacy-ARTICLE-2-1-LG-19.avif" alt="">
                      <i>The 2020 COPO Camaro John Force Edition was unveiled at the 2019 SEMA Show. It sold at the Scottsdale edition of the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car in early 2020.</i>
                     
                      <p style="margin: -8rem 0rem;">During that time, many of those engineers worked on a variety of <br> special-edition cars. They included vehicles bearing the names <br> of both John and Courtney Force, a 50th Anniversary Edition <br>special 572 and 632 Big-Block engine versions, a Hot Wheels <br>model, and more. Some of the one-of-one models or low serial <br> numbers went to collectors, often for charity. <br><br>

                        “GM leadership made a decision early on in the program that we <br> were going to auction off some of the more memorable cars <br>and then donate to charity that proceeds,” O’Blenes says. <br>“So, the COPO was a really good opportunity to be able to <br>generate a significant amount of funds for nonprofit <br>organizations through the years.” <br><br>
                        
                        At the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction alone, COPOs have <br>raised close to two million dollars for charities since 2012. <br>
                        
                        Another of the most memorable cars was the eCOPO, introduced at <br>the 2018 SEMA Show. The car featured an electric propulsion <br> system. The powertrain setup was an early example of <br>Chevrolet Performance’s available eCrate system and the COPO <br>helped spearhead the automotive aftermarket’s electric <br>offerings. That was the same year the 50th Anniversary COPO <br>was unveiled and represented the program’s vision for the <br>future while also honoring its past.</p>
