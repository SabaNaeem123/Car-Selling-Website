            <p>Chevrolet driver Kyle Larson dominated the Pennzoil 400 at Las Vegas Motor <br> Speedway on Sunday to score his first NASCAR Cup Series win of 2024 and <br>his second in a row at the 1.5-mile oval in Sin City.</p>

            <i>Kyle Larson celebrates after winning the Pennzoil 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Sunday. The victory was his first of 2024.</i>
            <p>Larson qualified second in his No. 5 Hendrick Motorsports Camaro ZL1, and <br>in a sign of things to come, took the lead for the first time on Lap 3. Larson <br> ultimately won the race’s first two stages, often opening leads of multiple <br> seconds. He led a race-high 181 circuits and held off one final challenge in the <br> event’s final laps to claim the 24th win of his career. <br><br>
                He also swept all the stages to take the win at the track last fall and turned <br> in a similar performance on Sunday.</p>

                <p>“All in all, such a great, great job by this No. 5 HendrickCars.com Chevy team,” <br> said Larson, who now has three career victories at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. <br>“Just their execution, restarts, pit road ... all of that was great. Cool to get a win <br>here in Las Vegas again, back-to-back, and swept all the stages. Can’t ask for <br>much more than that.” <br><br>

                    Team Chevy claimed three of the top-10 finishing positions in the race, with <br> Ross Chastain taking the fourth spot and William Byron coming home 10th.</p>

                    <i>Team Chevy driver Ross Chastain finished fourth on Sunday.</i>
                    <p>With Larson’s victory, Chevrolet has won all three points-paying NACAR Cup <br> Series events contested thus far in 2024. The win was also the Bowtie Brand’s <br> 854th overall in NASCAR’s premier series, further extending its lead over <br> all other manufacturers. <br><br>

                        Hendrick Motorsports has claimed 10 victories at Las Vegas Motor Speedway <br> with five coming in the last seven events. Additionally, Chevrolet has triumphed <br>13 times at the Las Vegas track and has won four of five races featuring the <br> Cup Series Next Gen car. <br><br>
                        
                        On Friday, Chevrolet also continued its perfect record this year in the NASCAR <br> Craftsman Truck Series as Rajah Caruth drove his No. 7 Spire Motorsports <br> Chevrolet Silverado RST to his first career win in the Victoria’s Voice Foundation <br>200 in Las Vegas.</p>

                     <p> Larson, the 2021 Cup Series champion, and his team already look to be in title <br> form. Meanwhile, Chevrolet’s early-season strength this year is simply <br>unmatched across the board. <br><br>
